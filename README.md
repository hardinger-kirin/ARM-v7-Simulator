# ARM-v7-Simulator

This is an ARM v7 simulator project in my Computer Organization class in the Fall 2022 semester. The project is organized into 3 assignments with each assignment building upon the last. Each folder contains its own README documentation as well with greater detail.

Executing requires a UNIX terminal and g++ compiler.

Project 1: Completed October 1 2022 Functionality to add two unsigned 32 bit integers and account for when overflow occurs.

Project 2: Completed November 4 2022 Functionalities to add, subtract, arithmetic shift right, logical shift right/left, bitwise AND, bitwise NOT, bitwise ORR, and bitwise XOR unsigned 32 bit integers.

Project 3: Completed December 3 2022 Added functionality for immediate values, and representation of registers. Formatted input as ARM commands.
